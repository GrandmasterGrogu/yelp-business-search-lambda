# Yelp Search on Amazon Lambda
I'm not affiliated with Yelp or Amazon in any way. This is just one preliminary piece of a pet project of mine ;)
# Setup

  - Create a Yelp API key / account.
  - Create an Amazon Lambda account.
  - Create a new Lambda function and select this script from the marketplace (if I put it there eventually), or download the zip of this repo and upload it via the 'code entry type' field.
